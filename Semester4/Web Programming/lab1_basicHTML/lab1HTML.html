                    Squirrels are nimble, bushy-tailed rodents found all over the world. They belong to the Sciuridae family, which includes prairie dogs, chipmunks and marmots.
                    There are more than 200 species of squirrels, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), and they are categorized into three types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>tree squirrels</li>
                        <li>ground squirrels</li>
                        <li>flying squirrels</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        These rodents have remarkable little bodies. For example, a squirrel has padded feet that cushions jumps from up to 20 feet (6 meters) long. 
                        Their eyes are high on their head and placed on each side of the head so they can see a large amount of their surroundings without having to turn their head. 
                        They are also fantastic runners. Squirrels can run 20 mph (32 kph).
                        <br>
                        They have four teeth in the front of their mouth that constantly grow throughout their lives. This ensures that their teeth don't wear down to nubs from gnawing on nuts and other objects.

                        A group of squirrels are called a scurry or dray. They are very territorial and will fight to the death to defend their area. Mother squirrels are the most vicious when defending their babies.

                        Albino squirrels are quite popular in some parts of the United States.
